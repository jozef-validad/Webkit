Introduction
------------

This package contains a list of random WebKit hacks. The hacks are mainly
written in Perl using the introspection framework.

They rely on these two other githup projects:

    https://github.com/potyl/perl-Gtk3-WebKit
    https://github.com/potyl/perl-HTTP-Soup

How to Build
------------

This was tested on a brand new VM running Ubuntu 11.04. These intructions are
not very clean. They serve more as a reminder.

sudo apt-get install libextutils-depends-perl libextutils-pkgconfig-perl gobject-introspection libgirepository1.0-dev
sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev libwebkitgtk-3.0-0-dbg
sudo apt-get install gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-webkit-3.0 gir1.2-soup-2.4

Install from CPAN:

    Glib::Object::Introspection
    Cairo::GObject
    Gtk3
    Gtk3::WebKit
    HTTP::Soup

For better success use a recent version of WebKitGTK.
